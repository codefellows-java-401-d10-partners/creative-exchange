# Creative Exchange

A web application built by Andy Agulue, Edward Hou, James Mansour, and Seamus Brown.

So far unnamed but taking shape.

## Usage

Set the environment variables to include database credentials and API keys.

A PostgreSQL database and an AWS S3 deployment are currently required to run.

An example of the environment files that need to be set can be found in the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file.

`./gradlew bootRun` # Runs the application
